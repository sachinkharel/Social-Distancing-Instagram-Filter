# Social-Distancing-Instagram-Filter
An Instagram Filter using distance measuring patch to practice social distancing.

------ This AR FILTER is made on SPARK AR STUDIO --------
In this filter, I have used an inbuilt patch named camera distance which calculates the distance from the camera to the specified object(in this case - users face). So, this calculated the distance from the device to users face and shows a green tick signal if users 1.5m distance from the device but shows red signal with corona-virus floating animation otherwise.
